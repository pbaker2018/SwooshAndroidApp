# SwooshAndroidApp

This a basic 4-page Android App, built using Kotlin and Android Studio.

It demonstrates the use of constraint layout, toggle buttons, toasts, a progress bar and persisting data between activities.


# How does it work?

- On the homepage, you click on 'Get Started'.

- Then you select the type of league you are interested in.

- Then click on 'Next'

- NOTE: IF YOU CLICK ON 'NEXT' WITHOUT SELECTING A LEAGUE, AN ERROR MESSAGE (TOAST) WILL COME UP.

- Then click on which level you are.

- Then click on 'Finish'

- NOTE: IF YOU CLICK ON 'FINISH' WITHOUT SELECTING A LEVEL, AN ERROR MESSAGE (TOAST) WILL COME UP.

- The app will then go to the final page, but it doesn't actually find any 'leagues near you,' as I don't yet know how to do that.
